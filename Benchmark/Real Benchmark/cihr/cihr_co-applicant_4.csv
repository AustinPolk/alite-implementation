By gaining insights to the disease mechanisms, we may be successful in developing an innovative approach to treat cancers residing in non-operable sites. The project will borrow from concepts of autoimmunity, and test our immune system's ability to clear tumor cells. Stem cells will be used to generate neural tumors and the integrity of the brain's immune-privileges will be explored. The health implications to this study would be its ability to circumvent current limitations in brain tumor therapy."
